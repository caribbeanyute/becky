The Book E-Commerce System will allow any user to create an account to become a customer. The customer, through the process of account creation, will have the option to become a member of the site. The system will allow customers to browse, search, select, and add books to a shopping cart. Then, provided they have books in their shopping cart, check out books in shopping cart and decrement the stock that the inventory the system maintains. The BECS also allows a manager to manage the inventory with full create, retrieve, update and delete (CRUD) functionality with regards to books in the system. It will also allow, on an inventory wide basis, customers and managers to interact with a promotion system that handles percentage-off promotions that can be applied to memberâ€™s orders. This interaction includes the creation (by managers) and the application to orders (by customers) of the promotions. The BECS has full email capabilities; the automated email functionality will be used to send promotions to members of the system as well as provide the managers with low-stock notifications.
